This assignment serves to reinforce responsive layouts, exercise positioning with CSS and Sass

## Objectives

* Exercise control of CSS display types, positioning
* Reinforce concepts of layout and display types
* Practice Sass (scss) and using semantic tags
* Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to create a responsive layout in HTML and CSS from scratch using Sass and semantic tags.

Note that you must use Sass (scss) including many of the concepts we've covered: variables, nesting, mixins, separate files (partials).

## Your Mission

Recreate the following layout in HTML and CSS (Sass).

* At large widths the entries should fill most of page with reasonable space on the left and right.
* At tablet widths the entries should fill the page with very little space on either side.
* At mobile widths the date and time should appear above the entry text instead of to the left of the timeline.
